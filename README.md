This is a personal portfolio website. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience.

## Development

To get started with the React project:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
This will launch the application in your browser, typically at http://localhost:3000.
